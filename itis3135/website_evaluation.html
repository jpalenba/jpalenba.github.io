                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The site employs a chaotic mix of colors and backgrounds, leading to visual confusion and difficulty in distinguishing between different sections.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: There is a lack of consistent styling; various fonts, colors, and design elements are used haphazardly, resulting in a disjointed appearance.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The layout appears cluttered, with images and text placed arbitrarily without a clear alignment, making navigation cumbersome.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Unrelated items are crammed together, and related content is scattered, forcing users to sift through overwhelming information to locate what they need.</li>
