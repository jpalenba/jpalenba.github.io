        <h1>Contract</h1>
        <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Jose A. Palen Baez</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2025, ITIS 3135, with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. (Note - don’s use the caps- but replace those with your data, with normal letter casing)

            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
            
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
            
            Signed: Jose A. Palen Baez , 2/2/2025 </p>
